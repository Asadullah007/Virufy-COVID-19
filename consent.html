                            <p>You are invited to participate in a research study on the signs and symptoms associated with early-onset and advanced COVID-19.
                                The data to be collected will be used for the development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based COVID-19 risk assessment application. 
                                This application will be used by physicians to determine how to distribute scarce COVID-19 tests.
                                You will be asked to record your voice coughing. These recordings and videos will be used to train machine learning models.
                                You give consent for your video/audio recordings to be used for Training machine models. Additionally, your recordings may be used for future presentations and publications.
